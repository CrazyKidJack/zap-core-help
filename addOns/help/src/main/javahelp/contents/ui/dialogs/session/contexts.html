<H1>Session Context screens</H1>
<p>
These screens allow you manage <a href="../../../start/features/contexts.html">contexts</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is a set of screens for each context you define.
</p>

<H3>Top screen</H3>
This allows you to set the context name and description.

<H3>Include in Context</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be included in the context.<br/>
URLs which don't match any of the regexs will not be included in the context.
<br><strong>Note:</strong> The regular expressions must match the whole URL.

<H3>Exclude from Context</H3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be excluded from the context.<br/>
You only need to specify regexs for URLs that you do not want to include but which match one or more
of the 'include' regexes.
<br><strong>Note:</strong> The regular expressions must match the whole URL.

<H3><a name="struct">Structure</a></H3>
See the <a href="context-struct.html">Session Context Structure screen</a>.

<H3>Technology</H3>
This allows you to specify the technologies used in the context, if known.<br/>
By default all technologies are included.<br/>
If you exclude technologies that you know are not used then this may speed up 
<a href="../../../start/features/ascan.html">active scanning</a> as rules specific to the excluded
technologies can be skipped.

<H3><a name="auth">Authentication</a></H3>
See the <a href="context-auth.html">Session Context Authentication screen</a>.

<h3><a name="sm">Session Management</a></h3>
This allows you to configure how Session Management is handled for the Context. 
When you select a Session Management method, additional options will apear specific to that method.

<h4>Cookie-Based Session Management</h4>
No configuration is needed for this session management method. <small>Read  
<a href="../../../start/features/sessionManagement.html#cbsm">more</a>...</small>

<h4>HTTP Authentication Session Management</h4>
No configuration is needed for this session management method. <small>Read
<a href="../../../start/features/sessionManagement.html#hasm">more</a>...</small>

<h4>Script-Based Session Management</h4>

To use this session management method, follow these steps:
<ol>
	<li>Create (and save) a <b>Session Management Script</b> using the <b>Scripts</b> tab.<br/>
	    (see the provided examples and templates for this script type in the Scripts tab)</li>
	<li>Select your script by name from the dropdown list</li>
	<li>Press the <b>Load</b> button. Any configuration parameters declared in the script will appear.<br/>
	    <b>Required</b> parameters will be marked with as asterisk (*).</li>
	<li>Enter data to define the values of the parameters.<br/>
	    These values can be used in the script as seen in the provided Session Management script examples.</li>
	<li>After entering values, re-load the script by pressing the <b>Load</b> button again.
		<ul><li><strong>Note:</strong> Forgetting this step can cause unexpected values to be used during script execution which can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.</li></ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="users">Users</a></h3>
This allows you to configure a set of Users that may be used for various other actions
throughout the application.
<p>The credentials section of the Users depends on the Authentication Method configured
for the Context.</p>

<H2><a name="custompages">Custom Page</a></H2>
This functionality allows you to handle situations in which the target does not return a RFC compliant or expected error response when for conditions such as 
404 - Not Found, 500 - Internal Server Error, etc. Often developers implement custom 404 or 500 handling but do not actually return an appropriate status code.
Leveraging Custom Page definitions you can define URLs or response content which identify error responses regardless of the status code associated with the response.
<small>Read <a href="../../../start/features/custompages.html">more</a>...</small>

<H2>URL regexs</H2>
In the <I>Include in *</I>, <I>Exclude from *</I> panels and the <i>Logged in/out indicators</i> of the <i>Authentication</i> panel, etc. you can enter regular expressions to define excluded URLs.
While you can escape a single meta-character with a backslash, you can also use the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence. All the characters between the <B>\Q</B> and the <B>\E</B> are interpreted as literal characters. E.g. \Q*\d+*\E matches the literal text *\d+*.
This escape sequence is used in ZAP when you exclude URLs via some context menus.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> If your URL contains a "\E", then you have to do the following steps when using the <B>\Q...\E</B> escape sequence:
<UL>
	<LI>Open the escape sequence</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence before the "character" \E</LI>
	<LI>Escape the backslash</LI>
	<LI>Open after the "\E" another escape sequence;</LI>
	<LI>Close the escape sequence as normally would.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
Example: subdomain.example.com/path?a=<B>\E</B>&amp;moredata=2 should appear as
<I>\Qsubdomain.example.com/path?a=\E</I><B>\\E</B><I>\Q&amp;moredata=2\E</I>
